Standing up from the crater in the road it left, the figure picked up speed after the woman. Stumbling from the wave of force the figure made on impact, the woman was eventually overcome with the crowd that chased her. She rolled underneath a punch and countered with the briefcase, swept her leg under a figure to her side, and then fought off two more with her knife. After picking her momentum back up, the woman observed the paths in front of her. The main street continued for another few meters, branching off <a href="../page5/p5index.html">left</a> and <a href="../page5/p5bindex.html">right</a> with a bank splitting the difference. The woman rapidly approached an <a href="../page6/p6index.html">alleyway</a> in between two tall buildings on her right side.
