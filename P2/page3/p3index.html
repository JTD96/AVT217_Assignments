She weaved to the right, the nodes of the taser whizzing past her face and leaving the wire that connects the nodes to the gun to hang limply. She stepped inward towards the armored figure that fired the taser and bashed it across the head with her briefcase. She then took a knife from her belt and tossed it towards another approaching figure. The figure blocked the knife with its plated forearm, only for the woman to grab the knife back out of the air as she bolted towards this figure. Still running, the woman threw the same knife at the figure’s feet. When the figure lifted its foot to dodge, the woman leapt forward with a kick and knocked the figure prone. Using the same momentum, the woman skidded along the grass with the figure’s head beneath her heel for a second before stepping off to keep running. As she started to delve <a href="../page4/p4index.html">into the forest,</a> she ducked and weaved between each figure that tried to stop her. Taser nodes flew by her head and body as she ran, still avoiding every obstacle in her path.
