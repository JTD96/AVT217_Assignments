		<p class="tab">The woman in white kept approaching the thief, slightly faster and with her gun lowered. The second her foot passed the briefcase, the thief pulled hard with her left hand. The briefcase came sliding along the ground behind the woman in white, crashing into her heels and sweeping her legs out from under her. The thief pulled the briefcase back to her hand, a thin reflection of razor wire shining in the moonlight between her hand and the briefcase. In the same motion, the thief drew a knife, kicked away the attacker’s gun, and trained the knife on the attacker’s neck. The woman in white recovered quickly from her fall, swiping at the knife blade with her sword. When the thief brought the knife back up, the blade was cleaved off at the hilt, singed with a glowing orange. She tossed the useless knife handle away and dodged another swipe from the rapier, standing back on her feet. Taking a more refined stance as she stood up, the woman in white slashed with her blade at the thief, who hopped about just outside of its range. The woman in white went for a stab with the blade, and the thief pivoted to the outside of her sword arm. The Black Fox grabbed her wrist and twisted, wrestling the blade from the attacker’s hands. In the same motion, she swept under the woman in white’s legs and pushed down on her head with her other hand, trying to force her to the ground. Just before she swept under, the woman in white lifted her foot and stepped down on the thief’s foot as it traveled underneath her, loosening her grip on the attacker. The woman in white then shoved the Black Fox off of her, resetting both of their positions. The thief went in for another attack, while the woman in white <a href="../page11/p11index.html">stood motionless.</a>
